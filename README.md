# fractalites
Java fractals, drawn with the standard draw library

`StdDraw.java` is base file

`Koch.java` --> draws koch curve
`Sierpinski.java` --> draws Sierpinski triangle

You can play around with the depth and colors! `StdDraw.setPenRadius(double radius)` sets line thickness and `StdDraw.setPenColors(int r, int g, int b)` sets pen color.
